  |   The First Tree is a third-person exploration game centered around     |
  |   two parallel stories: a fox trying to find her missing family, and    |
  |   a son reconnecting with his estranged father in Alaska. Players       |
  |   take control of the fox on a poignant and beautiful journey that      |
  |   crescendos at the source of life, and perhaps result in an            |
  |   understanding of death. Along the way, players can uncover            |
  |   artifacts and stories from the son's life as he becomes intertwined   |
  |   in the fox's journey towards The First Tree.                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Not a "fox simulator," but an emotional, intimate story by a          |
  |   one-man team with an ending you won't soon forget.                    |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Featuring a gorgeous, orchestral soundtrack by acclaimed artists      |
  |   like Message to Bears, Lowercase Noises, and Josh Kramer.             |
